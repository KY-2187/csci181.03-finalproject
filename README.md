# You Episode Tracker

An iOS app designed to help users keep track of their progress while watching Season 1 of the Netflix TV show "You". Built using SwiftUI, the app allows users to view a list of episodes, mark them as watched with a checkbox, and access episode details including images, summaries, and air dates. The app retrieves episode information from the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

## Features

* __Episode List:__ The app presents a comprehensive list of episodes from Season 1 of "You".
* __Checkbox Tracking:__ Users can mark episodes as watched by simply tapping on a checkbox beside each episode's name.
* __Episode Details:__ Tapping on an episode opens a separate page where users can view additional details, such as an episode image, a short summary, and the air date.
* __Persistence:__ The app implements persistence, so the user's watched episode checkboxes remain saved even if the app is closed or relaunched.
